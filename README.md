"Multi-sensory environments adaptation for the relaxation of children with neurodevelopmental disorders" 
Master thesis by Michael Lovisa, Politecnico di Milano  


  
    
ABSTRACT  
Neurodevelopmental disorders are a group of conditions that can arise in the early stages of the development of a child and, depending on the degree of severity, these disorders can affect multiple aspects of the entire life of an individual.   
Early therapy interventions are fundamental to cure, if possible, the disorders or at least alleviate the consequences.  
Relaxation can be beneficial to reduce anxiety, tension, potential aggression and improve concentration; it can be achieved using relaxation techniques, requiring in some case some form of training, or simply listening to music.  
Relaxing music has been suggested by research studies to have a greater effect if it is not familiar to the patient and if it contains changes in tempo and a limited presence of high frequencies.   
The objective of this thesis is to investigate the potentialities of these notions adapting a multisensory environment, created by music and lighting, to the child's state for one of the following goals: relaxation enhancement, training of the child's relaxation abilities, training to handle more musical stimuli.   
The developed Chrome application is controlled by the relaxation level of the child measured by a cheap MindFlex EEG headset, that also permits to collect data during sessions.   
The music, programmed by a composer on a separate audio environment implemented using the Web Audio API, uses the concepts of algorithmic music so it can vary, slightly or considerably, at every session.  
In response to the relaxation value, depending on the definition of adaptation for the goal of the session, the software modifies in real-time some combination of global or instrument-specific characteristics of the played music: volume, tempo and frequency content.  
Philips Hue lights are used to create an immersive environment expressing the link between sound and color, varying the brightness of the lights to reflect the volume or frequency content of the music through the concepts of chromestesia, a type of synesthetic experience.
